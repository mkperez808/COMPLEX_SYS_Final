95465_001 YOU WISHED TO KNOW ALL ABOUT MY GRANDFATHER
95465_003 WELL HE IS NEARLY NINETY THREE YEARS OLD
95465_005 HE DRESSES HIMSELF IN AN ANCIENT BLACK FROCK COAT USUALLY MINUS SEVERAL BUTTONS YET HE STILL THINKS AS SWIFTLY AS EVER
95465_007 A LONG FLOWING BEARD CLINGS TO HIS CHIN GIVING THOSE WHO OBSERVE HIM A PRONOUNCED FEELING OF THE UTMOST RESPECT
95465_009 WHEN HE SPEAKS HIS VOICE IS JUST A BIT CRACKED AND QUIVERS A TRIFLE
