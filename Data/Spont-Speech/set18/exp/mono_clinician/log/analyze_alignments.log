The optional-silence phone sil occupies 23.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 90.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 19.4% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,35.4,100)
