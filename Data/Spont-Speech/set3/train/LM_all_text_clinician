OKAY THAT SHOULD BE RECORDING US NOW ALRIGHT TO START OFF WITH TELL ME WHAT DO YOU HAVE GOING ON THIS WEEKEND I KNOW IT'S ONLY TUESDAY
I HAVE MY MCKENZIE <unk> THIS WEEKEND
OH YOU DO COOL EXCELLENT ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO DO ANYTHING
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PLAY DATE BUT I DON'T KNOW CAUSE I HAVE THEM EVERY OTHER WEEKEND SO ITS ITS HARD TO MAKE EVERY PLAN
MHMM
BUT WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO SELL THE HOUSE
RIGHT
SO WE'RE WORKING ON MAKING IT NICE INSIDE AND OUT
OKAY
AND THEN
YOU'RE IN HOWELL RIGHT NOW
MILLER AND WHITMORE LAKE
OH THAT'S RIGHT YES YOU'RE IN WHITMORE LAKE
YES YES
AND YOU MOVED TO WHITMORE LIKE IN THE PAST YEAR DIDN'T YOU
YEAH IN JUNE LAST JUNE
OKAY AND YOU'RE TRYING TO SELL THE HOUSE AGAIN
YEAH
OK WHY
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE BEING A LANDLORD IT'S TOO STRESS THERE'S TOO MUCH STUFF GOING ON BUT NOW THAT I HAVE HELP AND I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP HE'S VERY VERY HELPFUL
GOOD
AND SO WE WENT FROM HAVING THE PLACE NOT UNPACKED YET TO IT GOT UNPACKED EVERYTHING WHERE IT BELONGS
MHMM
AND WE ALSO WHEN WE WERE ANTICIPATING MOVING WENT THROUGH AND JUST COMPLETELY GOT RID OF TRUCKLOADS TRUCKLOADS AND TRUCKLOADS OF STUFF AND SO NOW IT'S MORE LIKE A HOUSE AND LESS LIKE A SALVATION ARMY
RIGHT RIGHT CAUSE WITH THE YEAH
SO IT'S IT'S WAY MORE PEACEFUL INSIDE SO IT'S IT'S NOT SOME PLACE THAT IS AS OVERWHELMING AS IT WAS AND SO IT'S I DON'T KNOW MAYBE WE WILL STAY
MHMM
BUT AND AND I PAID CASH A YEAR AGO BECAUSE MY PARENTS DIED AND SO I JUST I PAID CASH WITH THE INHERITANCE AND I MAYBE OVERPAID
OH NO
AND SO I HAD TALKED TO A RELATOR ABOUT SELLING IT AND ONE RELATOR SAID OH NO PROBLEM YOU PAID 300 WE COULD GET 300 AND THEN THE NEXT REALTOR SAID THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET 300
AH SHOOT
AND SO I'M I'M TRYING TO GET LOANS NOW TO TO FIX IT UP BECAUSE I HAD MONEY IN THE BANK BEYOND THAT BUT IT'S GONE NOW MOSTLY IN LEGAL FEES TRYING TO EVICT PRINCESS
YEAH
BUT BUT THERE'S STILL MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND SO BETWEEN THE MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND AND JUST THE STRESS OF BEING A LANDLORD IT'S OVERWHELMING
MHM
BUT IF I CAN GET A LOAN OR IF I CAN SELL IT I'LL BE HAPPY
MHMM
AND SO IT'S IT'S TROUBLE IT'S HARD GETTING A LOAN BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE COMMERCIAL IT MIGHT BE RESIDENTIAL
MHMM
IT'S DEFINITELY A WEIRD SITUATION IT'S NOT I CALLED ONE BANK AND THEY SAID OH WELL I'M DOING THE FORMULA AND YOUR INCOME IS NOT ENOUGH AND THE I KNOW I KNOW MY INCOME IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE I PAID CASH FOR IT A YEAR AGO BUT IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A LOAN FROM THE EQUITY ON THE HOUSE I CAN PAY YOU BACK AND IF I CAN'T YOU CAN HAVE THE HOUSE
MHMM
SO THAT'S THAT'S NOT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET A LOAN BASED ON THAT
WELL I DON'T KNOW EITHER
THROUGH SOMEBODY
YEAH YES WELL I MEAN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE YOU CAN TAKE A LOAN OUT USING YOUR HOUSE AS COLLATERAL
MHMM
THAT WAS DEFINITELY MY UNDERSTANDING SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE NOT GOING FOR THAT BUT MAYBE THEY I MEAN HOW MUCH MONEY ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL OUT JUST JUST TO FIX
JUST FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED
FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED JUST TO DO KIND OF UPDATES AND THINGS
MHMM YUP
AND DO YOU THINK YOU'LL GET THAT MONEY BACK WHEN YOU SELL IT
DEFINITELY
OKAY
YES
OKAY
AND EVEN IF IF I DON'T SELL IT FOR THAT MUCH JUST HAVING THE MONEY BEFORE THE NEXT MAINTENANCE ISSUE HAPPENS CAUSE ABOUT LAST MONTH IT WAS THE THE DRAINS ERUPTED WITH POOP AND SO IT WAS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET THE PLUMBER TO COME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
OH GEEZ
AND AND LIKE POWER WASH THE DRAINS AND SO THEY HAD TO COME WITH THE POWERFUL HOSE AND JUST GET ALL THE DRAINS CLEANED OUT AND AND SO THAT WAS TWO GRAND
OH GOD THAT'S MISERABLE
MHMM
YEAH YEAH I CAN SEE WHY BEING LIKE A LANDLORD WOULD BE SUCH A PAIN SOMETIMES
MHMM
CAUSE I FEEL LIKE THERE ARE ALWAYS LITTLE THINGS CROPPING UP AND I FEEL LIKE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL LANDLORDS ARE PROBABLY THE ONES WHO CAN DO A LOT OF THAT WORK THEMSELVES
YEAH
BUT THAT'S REALLY THAT'S HARD SOMETIMES
OR HIRE SOMEBODY THAT THEY TRUST
YEAH
AND NOT WASTE THEIR MONEY
RIGHT
AND WHEN I FIRST MOVED IN I WASTE A LOT OF MONEY BECAUSE I I COULDN'T FIND ANYONE WHO WOULD DO ANY WORK BUT THE RELATOR THAT I TALKED TO WHO SAID THAT I OVERPAID FOR THE HOUSE ALSO HAD A BUNCH OF CONTRACTORS AND PROPERTY MANGERS AND STUFF
