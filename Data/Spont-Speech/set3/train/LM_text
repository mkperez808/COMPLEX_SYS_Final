WE HAD A GARAGE SALE
NO I THINK IT WAS TOO HOT
YEAH IT WAS KIND OF A BAD LOCATION I THINK AWAY FROM THE ROAD
YEAH
NO
NO I DIDN'T SORRY
OKAY
FOR THIS WEEKEND UH NOTHING YET
NOTHING PLANNED YET
UH EXERCISE
THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS I DO SO IT COULD BE ONE OF ABOUT TEN DIFFERENT THINGS
I LIKE VARIETY
I HAVE MY MCKENZIE <unk> THIS WEEKEND
I THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A PLAY DATE BUT I DON'T KNOW CAUSE I HAVE THEM EVERY OTHER WEEKEND SO ITS ITS HARD TO MAKE EVERY PLAN
BUT WE ARE ALSO TRYING TO SELL THE HOUSE
SO WE'RE WORKING ON MAKING IT NICE INSIDE AND OUT
AND THEN
MILLER AND WHITMORE LAKE
YES YES
YEAH IN JUNE LAST JUNE
YEAH
BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE BEING A LANDLORD IT'S TOO STRESS THERE'S TOO MUCH STUFF GOING ON BUT NOW THAT I HAVE HELP AND I HAVE A RELATIONSHIP HE'S VERY VERY HELPFUL
AND SO WE WENT FROM HAVING THE PLACE NOT UNPACKED YET TO IT GOT UNPACKED EVERYTHING WHERE IT BELONGS
AND WE ALSO WHEN WE WERE ANTICIPATING MOVING WENT THROUGH AND JUST COMPLETELY GOT RID OF TRUCKLOADS TRUCKLOADS AND TRUCKLOADS OF STUFF AND SO NOW IT'S MORE LIKE A HOUSE AND LESS LIKE A SALVATION ARMY
SO IT'S IT'S WAY MORE PEACEFUL INSIDE SO IT'S IT'S NOT SOME PLACE THAT IS AS OVERWHELMING AS IT WAS AND SO IT'S I DON'T KNOW MAYBE WE WILL STAY
BUT AND AND I PAID CASH A YEAR AGO BECAUSE MY PARENTS DIED AND SO I JUST I PAID CASH WITH THE INHERITANCE AND I MAYBE OVERPAID
AND SO I HAD TALKED TO A RELATOR ABOUT SELLING IT AND ONE RELATOR SAID OH NO PROBLEM YOU PAID 300 WE COULD GET 300 AND THEN THE NEXT REALTOR SAID THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE GOING TO GET 300
AND SO I'M I'M TRYING TO GET LOANS NOW TO TO FIX IT UP BECAUSE I HAD MONEY IN THE BANK BEYOND THAT BUT IT'S GONE NOW MOSTLY IN LEGAL FEES TRYING TO EVICT PRINCESS
BUT BUT THERE'S STILL MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND SO BETWEEN THE MAINTENANCE ISSUES AND AND JUST THE STRESS OF BEING A LANDLORD IT'S OVERWHELMING
BUT IF I CAN GET A LOAN OR IF I CAN SELL IT I'LL BE HAPPY
AND SO IT'S IT'S TROUBLE IT'S HARD GETTING A LOAN BECAUSE IT MIGHT BE COMMERCIAL IT MIGHT BE RESIDENTIAL
IT'S DEFINITELY A WEIRD SITUATION IT'S NOT I CALLED ONE BANK AND THEY SAID OH WELL I'M DOING THE FORMULA AND YOUR INCOME IS NOT ENOUGH AND THE I KNOW I KNOW MY INCOME IS NOT ENOUGH BECAUSE I PAID CASH FOR IT A YEAR AGO BUT IF YOU COULD GIVE ME A LOAN FROM THE EQUITY ON THE HOUSE I CAN PAY YOU BACK AND IF I CAN'T YOU CAN HAVE THE HOUSE
SO THAT'S THAT'S NOT I DON'T KNOW I DON'T KNOW HOW TO GET A LOAN BASED ON THAT
THROUGH SOMEBODY
MHMM
JUST FIFTY OR ONE HUNDRED
MHMM YUP
DEFINITELY
YES
AND EVEN IF IF I DON'T SELL IT FOR THAT MUCH JUST HAVING THE MONEY BEFORE THE NEXT MAINTENANCE ISSUE HAPPENS CAUSE ABOUT LAST MONTH IT WAS THE THE DRAINS ERUPTED WITH POOP AND SO IT WAS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET THE PLUMBER TO COME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
AND AND LIKE POWER WASH THE DRAINS AND SO THEY HAD TO COME WITH THE POWERFUL HOSE AND JUST GET ALL THE DRAINS CLEANED OUT AND AND SO THAT WAS TWO GRAND
MHMM
