The optional-silence phone sil occupies 25.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 90.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 20.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.2 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 6.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (23,35.5,101)
